      <title>Extra domain</title>
      <link href="/2018/09/29/Extra-domain/"/>
      <url>/2018/09/29/Extra-domain/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I recently added an extra domain that will redirect to <code>i.fiery.me</code>, namely <code>lolis.will-always-want.me</code>. So you can instead use that when posting your meme in Discord and stuff.</p><p>Actually just using <code>will-always-want.me</code> without the <code>lolis</code> subdomain will work too, but only because I didn’t bother.</p><p>Anyways, the current active subdomain is only <code>lolis</code>, but I can add more subdomains later in the future. I don’t know, maybe like <code>your-mom.will-always-want.me</code> or something? Haha.</p><p>Do remember that it’s only a simple 301 redirect. Meaning, when someone opens the URL in their browser, they’ll end up at <code>i.fiery.me</code> instead. It works fine in Discord since their thumbnailer follows redirect.</p><p>Anyways, that’s all. See ya.</p>]]></content>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Just a heads up. Recently, it has come to my attention that the safe was being blacklisted by browsers due to malicious uploaded files.</p><p>So I’ve scanned all existing files and removed some infected uploads. I’ve also implemented virus scanning to the upload process using ClamAV, so hopefully it won’t be getting as much malicious uploads in the future. I’ve also submitted an appeal to Google,  so hopefully the safe will no longer be blacklisted soon.</p>]]></content>

      <url>/2018/05/16/Clarification-about-the-domains-used-for-the-safe/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there,</p><p>Some of you guys may have noticed that the safe has changed the domain used to serve files uploaded to it at least 3 times by now. Yeah, at first it was using <em>s.fiery.me</em>, then afterwards it used <em>the.fiery.me</em>, and now it uses <em>i.fiery.me</em>.</p><p>Yeah well.. back then I was like, “hey, this sounds good” and changed it.. twice, which leaves us with <em>i.fiery.me</em> now.</p><p>For old users, you’ll probably notice that all old links that were using <em>s.fiery.me</em> and <em>the.fiery.me</em> would still work, and that’s because I made both domain redirect to <em>s.fiery.me</em>. If you visit any of the old domains and see  your address bar, you’ll notice that you’ve been redirected.</p><p>So yeah, I have no plan on deleting both <em>s.fiery.me</em> and <em>the.fiery.me</em>, ever, so old and new users alike may feel free to use any of the aformentioned two domains or the current <em>i.fiery.me</em>.</p><p>That’s all. See ya folks!</p>]]></content>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there,</p><p>We now have uptime monitors for the safe and the hastebin that you can check out from here: <a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/OPwo4uOz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stats.uptimerobot.com/OPwo4uOz8</a>. It’s powered by <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uptime Robot</a>,  so props to the folks in there.</p><p>I wanted to use <em>status.fiery.me</em> as its custom domain, but Uptime Robot seem to have issues with their certificates when being used with Cloudflare’s Full SSL (Strict), so I had no choice but to link the default URL in this blog post.</p><p>On a side note, <em>i.fiery.me</em> is the domain used to serve files uploaded to the safe. Unlike the safe which runs on Node, <em>i.fiery.me</em> runs on Nginx, which means either may die while not involving the other, so I made an extra monitor for  it.</p><p>Anyways, that’s all. I hope you guys find it useful one way or another.</p><p>See ya.</p>]]></content>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there,</p><p>Just a small announcement, I’ve added a basic installation of hastebin at <a href="https://paste.fiery.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://paste.fiery.me/</a>. It should work as is with anything that supports hastebin by simply changing the domain.</p><p>I’ve been planning to add my own installation of paste/hastebin for a while but I only got around doing it today.</p><p>Anyways, it’s very basic so I’m not gonna comment further. If you want to use it, then feel free.</p><p>Oh yeah, I’d like to note that it does not have paste expiration yet. I’ll get to that someday in the future.</p><p>That’s all. See ya folks!</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> On a side note, if you think hastebin lack some features that you’d rather have in a pastebin-like sites, feel free to offer an alternative in the comment section. Preferably open-source ones of course. I didn’t really put much  thought when I chose hastebin after all.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Bash uploader</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/14/Bash-uploader/"/>
      <url>/2018/04/14/Bash-uploader/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently forked an open source project named <a href="https://github.com/jschx/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uguush</a>. It’s a command-line uploader for various file hosts, mainly pomf clones. If you are on *nix, it can be a simple replacement to ShareX, which is Windows-only.  You can check out my fork <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>My fork will upload to <a href="https://safe.fiery.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe.fiery.me</a> by default, but you can still use the other hosts available in it.</p><p><img src="https://the.fiery.me/yRYR.png" alt="uguush"></p><p>The main differences between my fork and master is the ability to use token and albums.</p><p>For example, running <code>uguush -w -t MY_TOKEN_HERE</code> will screenshot your active window and use <code>MY_TOKEN_HERE</code> as the token. If the token matches your account’s, you will be able to see your uploaded screenshot from the safe’s dashboard.</p><p>Then if you run <code>uguush -f -t MY_TOKEN_HERE -a 1</code>, a fullscreen screenshot will be taken and uploaded to your account, and as long as you have an album with ID 1, the screenshot will be added to that album. I have updated albums list in safe.fiery.me  to show the albums’ ID a few days ago to help you in getting their IDs.</p><p>Other than capturing active window and fullscreen, it can also capture selection with <code>-s</code> option.</p><p>By default, it depends on <a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/maim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/slop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slop</a>, but if you have <a href="https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/spectacle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE Spectacle</a>, then you can use  <code>-k</code> option to replace both maim and slop with it.</p><p>Other than that, I also added <code>-i</code> option which you can use to apply shadow effect into active window capture when using maim/slop, just like spectacle. But unlike spectacle, even when the active window is maximized, it will still apply the  shadow effect. Truthfully though, I ended up not using that option ever since I got spectacle. It was merely an experiment in the first place.</p><p>Anyways, if you want to use it, you can add custom shortcuts if you want. At least on my end I’ve replaced all spectacle shortcuts with this.</p><p>On a side note, technically my fork is compatible with all lolisafe-based host. You’ll just have to manually edit the host from safe.fiery.me to other lolisafe-based host. Afterwards both token and albums feature should work just fine.</p><p>Okay, that’s all from me for today folks. See you all next time~</p>]]></content>

      <title>No-JS Uploader</title>
      <link href="/2018/04/13/No-JS-Uploader/"/>
      <url>/2018/04/13/No-JS-Uploader/</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello guys, we meet again!</p><p>I’m dedicating this blog post to introduce the all new No-JS uploader page!</p><p>You can check it out from <a href="https://safe.fiery.me/nojs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>That uploader does not use any JavaScript in its front-end, so you can use it just fine with NoScript-like extension.</p><p>Unfortunately though, you will not be able to associate your uploads to your account, if you have any.</p><p>Back then I was thinking that I should probably add an input form in which you could enter your token if you wanted to. But then I thought that, if you would prefer to use the No-JS uploader, then it was likely that you would not bother making an account  anyways. After all, the Dashboard needs JavaScript. So yeah, in the end I decided not to add support for tokens to the No-JS uploader page.</p><p>Other than that, since we are behind CloudFlare, the maximum size that you can upload with the No-JS uploader page is 100 MB. For now the page says 300 MB, but that’s only when you are chunking your uploads to 100 MB or lower (just like the homepage uploader  which chunks your upload to 10 MB). I’ll try to make that page shows a different maximum file size in the future.</p><p>So yeah, that is all. Love you guys, and I hope you will find it useful~</p>]]></content>

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yayyyy~!</p><p>Good news! The safe now supports chunked uploads!</p><p>Chunked uploads? Nani the heck is that?</p><p>Well, basically, your uploads will be split into a bunch of smaller files!<br>.. but why?<br>Well, there are a couple of good reasons! But there’s one that’s very important among them all, in my opinion at least, and that is, we can finally “bypass” Cloudflare’s  100MB upload limit!</p><p>If your file is larger than 100MB, then we can just split them into multiple smaller files and upload all those pieces instead! Afterwards the server will simply have to rebuild the files, and tadaa~, a file larger than 100MB successfully uploaded through  Cloudflare~!</p><p>At the moment, the safe will split files into multiple 10MB pieces.<br>Which also means chunked uploads will only be enabled for files larger than 10MB.</p><p>So yeah, anyways, with that I’ve also raised the safe’s max file size to 300MB~!</p><p>That’s all from me for today folks~ See ya~!</p>]]></content>
