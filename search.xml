        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there,</p><p>Just a quick notice. Within the next few days I’ll be transferring the server to a new location in Paris, France. As some of you may know, our server is currently located in Singapore. The 1-year plan of this current server will be ending more or less in 3 weeks, and I’ve also been planning on getting a server with much bigger storage, so I decided that it’s time to move instead of renewing the current server’s plan.</p><p>During the moving, <code>safe.fiery.me</code> and <code>paste.fiery.me</code> will go down. However, <code>fiery.me</code>, <code>blog.fiery.me</code> (this blog), and especially <code>i.fiery.me</code> (the domain serving uploaded files) will remain active.</p><p>I can’t really specify an ETA as this will be the first time I’m moving an entire server to another. I still haven’t tested how fast the connection is from the current server to the new server either. It may take a couple hours, or it may even take a whole day or more.<br>So yeah, be prepared.</p><p>However, you all can be rest assured that it will come back. ✌️</p><p>I’ll be posting any updates in the comment section (we’re using Disqus - in case someone blocks that and so haven’t noticed).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Edited post. This was originally posted at 16/05/2018.</em></p><p>Hello there,</p><p>We now have uptime monitors for the safe and the <del>hastebin</del> PrivateBin that you can check out from here: <a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/OPwo4uOz8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stats.uptimerobot.com/OPwo4uOz8</a>. It’s powered by <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uptime Robot</a>, so props to the folks in there.</p><p><del>I wanted to use <em>status.fiery.me</em> as its custom domain, but Uptime Robot seem to have issues with their certificates when being used with Cloudflare’s Full SSL (Strict), so I had no choice but to link the default URL in this blog post.</del></p><p>* <a href="https://status.fiery.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://status.fiery.me</a> will now redirect to the URL above.</p><p>On a side note, <em>i.fiery.me</em> is the domain used to serve files uploaded to the safe. Unlike the safe which runs with Node + Nginx, <em>i.fiery.me</em> runs only with Nginx, which guarantees that even when Node dies, files can still be served. So, I made an extra monitor for it.</p><p>Anyways, that’s all. I hope you guys find it useful one way or another.</p><p>See ya.</p><p><strong>UPDATE 01/02/2019:</strong> Update, uwu~</p><p>A user recently mentioned that Uptime Robot isn’t fast enough. I can certainly agree with that as it only checks every 5 minutes, so at most it can only be used as rough estimates of the total uptime (I, on the other hand, intended that as a “proof” that the safe have +99% uptime).</p><p>The said user also recommended me an uptime check tool from Website Planet, that seems to only check the uptime everytime you actually visit the status page.</p><p>It seems to work like any other one-time uptime checker tool thing, but it looks pretty good to me, so I’ll also link it down below.</p><p><code>https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/down-or-not?page=https%3A%2F%2Fsafe.fiery.me%2Fnojs</code></p><p>One thing to note when using this sort of tool, if you want immediate (a.k.a not “cached”) result, you should always check uptime status of the <code>/nojs</code> route instead (<code>https://safe.fiery.me/nojs</code>).</p><p>Reason being, we are caching almost all front-end pages, excluding that route. So when the safe is actually down, you will not be able to upload anything, but can still access the safe’s homepage just fine (<code>/nojs</code> route on the other hand is a dynamic page, so we are not caching that).</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there, another update post here~</p><p>If you haven’t noticed, a few days ago we’ve disabled URL uploads. It was mainly because DuckDuckGo stopped serving <code>Content-Length</code> header for their proxy. The header was crucial so that the server could predict the file size without having to download it.</p><p>Other than that, file extensions that do not have specific mime types will now be served as <code>text/plain</code> instead of <code>application/octet-stream</code>. What this means is that, browsers will now stop asking those files to be saved and instead will try to display their content, as text, right on your browser (usually you can still configure this behavior on your browser’s preferences).</p><p>To be specific, this only applies to file extensions that aren’t being recognized by nginx’s mime types table. Most common extensions will work as normal.</p><p>You can still save the content by “right click &gt; save page as”, or something along that line.</p><p>That’s all for now.

      <title>Issue with Cloudflare API and its impact to the safe</title>
      <link href="/2018/10/01/Issue-with-Cloudflare-API/"/>
      <url>/2018/10/01/Issue-with-Cloudflare-API/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,</p><p>Sorry for this, in the past few days, a bit over 7 days to be exact, we have been having some issue with Cloudflare API. Mainly, we keep on getting “TCP connection reset” when making any requests to the API. I have contacted the server host but I was told to contact Cloudflare directly (to be honest I was more inclined to believe it was an issue with the server host).</p><p>So what does that mean for us exactly?</p><p>First, we are using Cloudflare as the CDN for your data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read more</a>). When you delete your files from safe.fiery.me, they will immediately be deleted from our server, but they will still exist in Cloudflare’s caches. So we have automated this so that whenever you delete your files, our server will also make a request to Cloudflare API, telling them to also delete the files from their caches. But now that we are unable to connect to Cloudflare API, your files will still remain in Cloudflare’s caches and be accessible through the URLs we have assigned to your files.</p><p>But still, the actual situation is not really that bad. All these times, we have always had <code>must-revalidate</code> and <code>proxy-revalidate</code> in the HTTP headers of all of the files served through our server (<a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003206852-Origin-Cache-Control" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read more</a>), which means Cloudflare will keep on revalidating the files; checking things like whether they are still serving the exact same files or whether the files themselves still exist in our server.</p><p>Though even then, the process will not be instantaneous and may even take up to a full 24 hours until Cloudflare notice the files have been deleted from our server.</p><p>So yeah, please bear with this for now. Meanwhile I will try to contact Cloudflare for more information.</p>]]></content>

      <link href="/2018/09/29/Extra-domain/"/>
      <url>/2018/09/29/Extra-domain/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys,</p><p>I recently added an extra domain that would redirect to <code>i.fiery.me</code>, namely <code>lolis.will-always-want.me</code>. So you can instead use that when posting your meme in Discord and stuff.</p><p>Actually just using <code>will-always-want.me</code> without the <code>lolis</code> subdomain would work too, but only because I didn’t bother.</p><p>Anyways, the current active subdomain is only <code>lolis</code>, but I can add more subdomains later in the future. I don’t know, maybe like <code>your-mom.will-always-want.me</code> or something? Haha.</p><p>Do remember that it’s only a simple 301 redirect. Meaning, when someone opens the URL in their browser, they’ll end up at <code>i.fiery.me</code> instead. It works alright in Discord since their thumbnailer follows redirect.</p><p>Anyways, that’s all. See ya.</p>]]></content>

If you visit any of the old domains and see your address bar, you’ll notice that you’ve been redirected.</p><p>So yeah, I have no plan on deleting both <em>s.fiery.me</em> and <em>the.fiery.me</em>, ever, so old and new users alike may feel free to use any of the aformentioned two domains or the current <em>i.fiery.me</em>.</p><p>That’s all.

      <url>/2018/04/14/Bash-uploader/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p><p>I recently forked an open source project named <a href="https://github.com/jschx/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uguush</a>. It’s a command-line uploader for various file hosts, mainly pomf clones. If you are on *nix, it can be a simple replacement to ShareX, which is Windows-only. You can check out my fork <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/uguush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>My fork will upload to <a href="https://safe.fiery.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safe.fiery.me</a> by default, but you can still use the other hosts available in it.</p><p><img src="https://the.fiery.me/yRYR.png" alt="uguush"></p><p>The main differences between my fork and master is the ability to use token and albums.</p><p>For example, running <code>uguush -w -t MY_TOKEN_HERE</code> will screenshot your active window and use <code>MY_TOKEN_HERE</code> as the token. If the token matches your account’s, you will be able to see your uploaded screenshot from the safe’s dashboard.</p><p>Then if you run <code>uguush -f -t MY_TOKEN_HERE -a 1</code>, a fullscreen screenshot will be taken and uploaded to your account, and as long as you have an album with ID 1, the screenshot will be added to that album. I have updated albums list in safe.fiery.me to show the albums’ ID a few days ago to help you in getting their IDs.</p><p>Other than capturing active window and fullscreen, it can also capture selection with <code>-s</code> option.</p><p>By default, it depends on <a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/maim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maim</a> and <a href="https://github.com/naelstrof/slop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slop</a>, but if you have <a href="https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/spectacle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE Spectacle</a>, then you can use <code>-k</code> option to replace both maim and slop with it.</p><p>Other than that, I also added <code>-i</code> option which you can use to apply shadow effect into active window capture when using maim/slop, just like spectacle. But unlike spectacle, even when the active window is maximized, it will still apply the shadow effect. Truthfully though, I ended up not using that option ever since I got spectacle. It was merely an experiment in the first place.</p><p>Anyways, if you want to use it, you can add custom shortcuts if you want. At least on my end I’ve replaced all spectacle shortcuts with this.</p><p>On a side note, technically my fork is compatible with all lolisafe-based host. You’ll just have to manually edit the host from safe.fiery.me to other lolisafe-based host. Afterwards both token and albums feature should work just fine.</p><p>Okay, that’s all from me for today folks. See you all next time~</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello guys, we meet again!</p><p>I’m dedicating this blog post to introduce the all new No-JS uploader page!</p><p>You can check it out from <a href="https://safe.fiery.me/nojs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>That uploader does not use any JavaScript in its front-end, so you can use it just fine with NoScript-like extension.</p><p>Unfortunately though, you will not be able to associate your uploads to your account, if you have any.</p><p>Back then I was thinking that I should probably add an input form in which you could enter your token if you wanted to. But then I thought that, if you would prefer to use the No-JS uploader, then it was likely that you would not bother making an account anyways. After all, the Dashboard needs JavaScript. So yeah, in the end I decided not to add support for tokens to the No-JS uploader page.</p><p>Other than that, since we are behind CloudFlare, the maximum size that you can upload with the No-JS uploader page is 100 MB. For now the page says 300 MB, but that’s only when you are chunking your uploads to 100 MB or lower (just like the homepage uploader which chunks your upload to 10 MB). I’ll try to make that page shows a different maximum file size in the future.</p><p>So yeah, that is all. Love you guys, and I hope you will find it useful~</p>]]></content>

That’s a lot of reduction!<br>Example (NSFW-ish): <a href="https://i.fiery.me/ohVJ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://s.fiery.me/ohVJ.jpg</a></p><p>Other than some other custom fixes, it’s also now up-to-date with <a href="https://github.com/WeebDev/lolisafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WeebDev/lolisafe</a>. And yeah, you can still check whatever changes I’ve added in the fork <a href="https://github.com/BobbyWibowo/lolisafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BobbyWibowo/lolisafe</a>.</p><p>That’s all~</p>]]></content>
